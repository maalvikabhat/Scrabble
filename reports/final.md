Scrabble

The goal of this project was to create a program in C that would produce a list of all the possible words that can be made from a given set of letters. I wanted it to act almost as a cheat for Scrabble (or a similar word game). I created an easy-to-use interface where users can input upto 20 letters and a list of words (in alphabetic order) is shown. 

My learning goals were to get more comfortable with C, further grapple with the idea of recursion, and not use an API (apart from standard functions). Since this was my first time ever working in C, I wanted to take it slow with a project that I could also do in Python. I wanted to get used to the way functions work in C, and play around a little with the permutations and combinations that are possible.

Some of the most helpful resources were definitely my peers and the course assistants. Talking through ideas was the most important aspect of me making my design decisions. 

The final product is a C program that produces a list of all the possible words that can be made from the given string (set of letters). I did not use an API, apart from standard functions. Unfortunately, the program has some performance problems. It only works when the user enters a string of less than 8 letters.

In scrabble.c, I wanted to define the movement of the first element of the output string. I was not sure how to do this, but decided that fixer_in will act as the placeholder for input string. It basically represents the element of the input string that will go in the first position of the output string.

In this project, I definitely achieved my learning goals. I feel much more comfortable programming in C and making design decisions regarding recursion. My final product definitely lands closer to the lower bounds, but I am still very proud of the outcome. I spent a lot of time trying to create efficient code, and I think I did a good job with that.
