Project 1

The goal of this project is to create a program in C that will produce a list of all the possible words that can be made from a given set of letters. It will act almost as a cheat for Scrabble (or a similar word game). I plan to create an easy-to-use interface where users can input upto 20 letters and a list of words (in alphabetic order) will be shown. A lower bound that I am confident I can acheive is the function of the program, and a stretch goal is to create a visually aesthetic unscrambling platform.

My learning goals are definitely to get more comfortable with C, further grapple with the idea of recursion, and not use an API (apart from standard functions). Since this is my first time ever working in C, I want to take it slow with a project that I could also do in Python. I want to get used to the way functions work in C, and play around a little with the permutations and combinations that are possible.

To get started, I want to find a text file of some sort that I can use as a dictionary. Basically, a list of words that the program will sift through to find the possible words for the letters inputted. I think I will be able to find this somewhere online. 

First steps: 
1. Find a usable "dictionary" (list of all words). Either find a text file or convert it to a text file. Mark item on Trello Board when done.
2. Push the "dictionary" to the GitHub repository. Mark item on Trello Board when done.
3. Play with some unscrambling tools on the internet to get inspiration on how I want the user-interface to look. Mark item on Trello Board when done.
4. Read about input and output strings in C for familiarity purposes. Mark item on Trello Board when done.
